Colours

* Icons in the body of the website features are in a distinct red which is accentuated when hovered to which attracts the eye to the symbols and text.

Styling

 * The website has been styled to include distinct sections for each main area of the website for easy functionality and navigation.
 * The colour scheme and fonts run throughout the website, providing flow between different sections.

Images

* The top background image of the gym environment is used to bring the website to life and the inclusion of the word 'strength' immediately conveys a positive message to the user.
* Images of current users have been used in the testimonial section so that new users can relate to real life examples of how the Swiftly programme can work.

Fonts

* Ubuntu - this font was used for the Swiftly logo as referred to above.
