### UX

#### Project Objective

The primary objective of Swiftly is to provide an accessible fitness hub so that users have all the tools they require to achieve their personal health and fitness goals.

#### Design Choices

Logo

* Logo font used is Ubuntu from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?selection.family=Ubuntu) , a sans serif font chosen for its classic but modern feel which works well to represent the fitness industry
* Dumbbell icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/dumbbell?style=solid). Simple icon associated with the fitness industry

Colours

* The main colours of the website and app include white for the logo and text which provides a clear clean image which contrasts against the gym background image. The green used in the subsections such as testimonial give a feeling of energy and concentration towards the desired end users goals.
* Icons in the body of the website features are in a distinct red which is accentuated when hovered to which attracts the eye to the symbols and text.

Styling

 * The website has been styled to include distinct sections for each main area of the website for easy functionality and navigation.
 * The colour scheme and fonts run throughout the website, providing flow between different sections.

Images

* The top background image of the gym environment is used to bring the website to life and the inclusion of the word 'strength' immediately conveys a positive message to the user.
* Images of current users have been used in the testimonial section so that new users can relate to real life examples of how the Swiftly programme can work.

Fonts

* Ubuntu - this font was used for the Swiftly logo as referred to above.
* Montserrat - this font has been used throughtout the website to style the headings and paragraphs. This font is easy to read when used at all sizes and fits the modern style of the website.

#### Wireframes 

The wireframes was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/), this was the initial part of the project in the planning stage.

These are available in both [mobile](/assets/Wireframes/swiftly-mobile.pdf) and [desktop](/assets/Wireframes/swiftly-desktop.pdf) versions.

### Testing

#### W3C Code Validation

* [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* [W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/)
    - The developer used **W3C CSS Validation Service** and **W3C  Markup Validation Service** to check the validity of the website code.

I used the above links to check for any errors in my code, this is the intial step to testing any website for bugs and errors. W3C verfied i had no bugs or errors with my HTML and CSS.

#### Testing on different devices

#### Mobile/Tablet

* The website is designed to be responsive to work on mobile and tablet devices.
* Testing was required to ensure images, font size and headings adjusted accordingly.
* I used Google dev tools to check mobile view on different devices such as iphone 6/7/8 and galaxy. I used the same method for tablet view but this time i viewed on Ipad and Ipad pro.
* Another option was to use my own mobile device iphone 6 and 7 and a family members ipad pro.

#### Desktop 

* The website is designed to adjust to desktop view once the screen size increases, i reverted back to my wireframe design to make sure desktop view was as per the intended design and code.
* I used my Imac 27inch and Mac Book Pro 15inch to test the website on these devices.

#### Functionality Testing

* Checking navigation bar headers to make sure they navigate to the correct section of the website.
* Checking the carousel works correctly on the testimonials section.
* Making sure the social media links navigate correctly and using a hash tag on any other links that don't navigate anywhere.
